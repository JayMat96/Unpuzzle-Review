## Summary
*Unpuzzle* is a casual puzzle game developed by KekGames. The game consists of 50 levels. To move on to the next level, you must clear the screen of puzzle pieces. You do this by clicking and dragging the pieces in one of four directions. If there is another puzzle piece in the direction you are tosing a piece in, you cannot move that piece. You must find another way to get rid of that piece.

## Final Thoughts
*Unpuzzle* started off very simply. I was starting to think that it was too easy, but as I progress, new puzzle piece types appeared This added a twist to the game and made me focus on what I was doing. This made the game more challenging and fun.

There are a few problems I had with the game. For one, there is no Main Menu; the game starts on it's own. Another minor problem I found was that the music did not begin to play until after I had passed a level, though this might have been on purpose.
