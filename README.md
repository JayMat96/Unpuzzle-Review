## Summary
*Unpuzzle* is a casual puzzle game developed by KekGames. The game consists of 50 levels. To move on to the next level, you must clear the screen of puzzle pieces. You do this by clicking and dragging the pieces in one of four directions. If there is another puzzle piece in the way, you cannot toss a piece in that direction; you must find another way to get rid of that piece.

## Final Thoughts
*Unpuzzle* started off very simply. I was starting to think that it was too easy, but as I progressed, new puzzle piece types appeared. This added a twist to the game and made me focus on what I was doing. New puzzle piece types were introduced with the regular pieces, making the focus on the new pieces and how to clear them. As you progress, the different puzzle piece types are combined, making levels more complex. This made the game more challenging and fun. The design was very simple, making it easy to understand what to do. The music was calming and never became irritating.

There are a few problems I had with the game. For one, there is no Main Menu; the game starts on it's own. There was also no information about controls within the game. Another minor problem I found was that the music did not begin to play until after I had passed a level, though this might have been on purpose. 

However, there are no other problems aside from these few and even these are rather minor problems. It did not take me long to figure out how the controls work or how to play the game either. Even so, it would have been nice to include in-game instructions (I later found the controls by scrolling down the website's page). There was also a menu in the game, but that's not how you start the game. Although, the menu in the game was well designed. No text was needed, I was able to figure out what each symbol meant like sound toggle or level select. Being able to replay levels and then clicking a button to instantly go back to the latest level was a neat function to add into the game.

The game was more fun than I thought it was going to be and I enjoyed playing it. There is a moblie version with more levels which I might just pick up now. Not to mention, the simple controls would work great on a mobile device.
